For example, how will autonomous vehicles co-exist with light rail and other transit systems in 10 or 20 years and what impact will this have on our built environment? Our imagination and technical skills drive our solutions."}}}},{"node":{"id":"105cf969-1381-50d8-926b-ed80031203b2","frontmatter":{"title":"Hyperloop","sub_title":"A NEW FORM OF TRANSPORT","description":"Imagine traveling at airline speeds for the price of a bus ticket. AECOM is the only engineering company in the world to have planned, designed and constructed Hyperloop projects. Now we’re studying how the new high-speed transportation technology could efficiently transport goods between the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and inland distribution centers.","bg_image":"hyperloop_update-e1490619392265.jpg","menu_order":3,"author":{"image":"alaneckman-thumb-web.jpg","name":"Alan Eckman","position":"Transportation BD Director","testimonials":"The interconnectivity of transportation and energy infrastructure will be much more converged as we move more rapidly to a future of shared, electric and automated transportation solutions.

Our global team of high-speed rail specialists are applying experience from Hong Kong, China, Macao and Spain to conduct the engineering study for infrastructure design of the Singapore stretch.","bg_image":"high_speed_rail_3000x1400.jpg","menu_order":4,"author":{"image":"petervoorhees-thumb-web.jpg","name":"Peter Voorhees","position":"Urban Transportation Planning Manager","testimonials":"With few exceptions, U.S. passenger rail uses the same rail network that transports coal, oil and double-stacked containers. While that freight rail network does hold promise for effective passenger movement, a new network is needed for very fast passenger transport. Advances in the delivery of conventional passenger rail, high-speed equipment and emerging ultra-high speed modes (such as Hyperloop) portend a bright future for multimodal passenger transportation networks and high-density urban hubs."}}}},{"node":{"id":"f4b5a691-32e2-5cd5-9654-66199ac51e97","frontmatter":{"title":"Airports of Tomorrow","sub_title":"CLEARED FOR COMMERCE","description":"The Istanbul New Airport will have an initial capacity of 90 million passengers and is expected to contribute $20 billion to Turkey’s economy by 2025. AECOM designed all the airside works for the airport and partnered with Pininfarina to design an award-winning, 90-meter control tower inspired by tulips that will become one of the hallmarks of Istanbul.","bg_image":"future_hero_airport-e1490381585474.jpg","menu_order":5,"author":{"image":"bijanpashanamei-thumb-web.jpg","name":"Bijan Pashanamaei","position":"Senior Vice President, Director of Global Aviation","testimonials":"The significant presence of technology is accelerating the impact on airport operations from passengers processing, baggage handling and to ramp operations. The ability to collect real time data to optimize airport operations on a daily basis is becoming routine. The airports of the future will have the ability to flex operations quickly to correspond to peak operational needs to reduce overall infrastructure volumes. One of our core missions at Global Aviation is to assess the future trends in aircraft and airline operations and develop unique solutions that are based on leveraging existing infrastructures to reduce CAPEX and OPEX."}}}},{"node":{"id":"cb9ab088-8294-5978-940c-84837a6dbd01","frontmatter":{"title":"Space Travel","sub_title":"GATEWAY TO SPACE","description":"The world’s first hub for commercial space travel, Spaceport America, aims to enable affordable, efficient and effective access to space.
