    testimonials: "Someone once said to me that AECOM has every possible transportation technical expert on staff except rocket scientists, and I reminded them that our work actually includes supporting both government and commercial spaceflight. At any time, we can reach into our global organization and find someone with boundless talent in virtually any transportation specialty area."
