    testimonials: "With few exceptions, U.S. passenger rail uses the same rail network that transports coal, oil and double-stacked containers. While that freight rail network does hold promise for effective passenger movement, a new network is needed for very fast passenger transport. Advances in the delivery of conventional passenger rail, high-speed equipment and emerging ultra-high speed modes (such as Hyperloop) portend a bright future for multimodal passenger transportation networks and high-density urban hubs."
