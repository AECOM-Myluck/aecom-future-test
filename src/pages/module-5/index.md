    testimonials: "The significant presence of technology is accelerating the impact on airport operations from passengers processing, baggage handling and to ramp operations. The ability to collect real time data to optimize airport operations on a daily basis is becoming routine. The airports of the future will have the ability to flex operations quickly to correspond to peak operational needs to reduce overall infrastructure volumes. One of our core missions at Global Aviation is to assess the future trends in aircraft and airline operations and develop unique solutions that are based on leveraging existing infrastructures to reduce CAPEX and OPEX."
