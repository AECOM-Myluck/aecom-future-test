    testimonials: "As we address infrastructure challenges, we must consider the possible and not be limited by the tools and solutions available today. For example, how will autonomous vehicles co-exist with light rail and other transit systems in 10 or 20 years and what impact will this have on our built environment? Our imagination and technical skills drive our solutions."
